Moss
====

Moss is a [Conky][conky] like live wallpaper for android. It provides system statistics
such as uptime, cpu usage, network usage, top processes, and battery level.
It is highly configurable. Configuration tries to closely follow [Conky's][conky] syntax. 

For example configurations please see [the samples on the Moss site][samples].

# Build from Command Line

#### Some modifications by ohnonot:  
had to edit some files to make it compile on my system (archlinux, june 2017).  
Then I added my custom configuration (Ming Configuration).
Because on phone bootup, moss would not load an installed patch from the sdcard.  
I also removed one line of code that would draw a box around graphs; a feature i find ugly.  
most changes are likely specific to my setup (computer AND phone), but of course you're free to try.

#### Precompiled & unsigned .apk now included

It came to my attention that moss might not be available anymore either from f-droid or the google playstore.
Therefore I'm adding the compiled result from this fork: `moss-debug.apk`  
To install it, I guess you have to enable Settings => Security => Unknown sources.
